   <h2 class="line">Here's a time line of Virat Kohli's life:</h2>
   <ul id="tribute-info">
    <li><span class="bold">1988 - </span>In November 1988, Virat Kohli was born in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">2007 - </span>The Board of Control for Cricket in India introduced the Indian Premier League, a franchise-based T20 league. Among the franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by Vijay Mallya at the time, selected Kohli to join their team for a sum of $50,000 through a draft. This decision was influenced by his performance in the U19 World Cup in Malaysia which India won under him.[58]</li>
    <li><span class="bold">2008 - </span>The India debutIndia Virat made his One Day International (ODI) debut for India against Sri Lanka on August 18, 2008. The young and determined batter failed to score big in the match and was dismissed for mere 12 runs. However, Kohli bounced back stronger and scored his maiden half-century in the fourth match of the same series.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">2009 - </span>Emerging Players Tournament
        In July–August 2009, Kohli was selected to open the innings for the Indian Emerging Players team in the Emerging Players Tournament, held in Australia. He finished as the tournament's leading run-scorer, with a total of 398 runs from seven matches.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">2016 - </span>Kohli’s first series win as Test captain and India’s first away Test series win in four years came on the Sri Lanka tour in 2015.Apart from this, Kohli continued his consistent batting performance in the T20I format as well and won the second consecutive ‘Man of the Tournament’ award at the 2016 World Twenty20.
        Kohli concluded the season with record 973 runs in 16 matches, at an average of 81.08, establishing himself as the highest run-scorer of the tournament and claiming Orange Cap with the title of Most Valuable Player.[139] Team's coach, Vettori, praised Kohli for his contributions, stating:[140]</li>
    <li><span class="bold">2017 - </span>Kohli became the first batter to score double centuries in four consecutive Test series, breaking several records and establishing his dominance as a batsman. He even led India to the final of the ICC Champions Trophy the same year.
        Kohli captained India at the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, but India lost to Pakistan in the final. Kohli scored two double centuries that year in a Test series against Sri Lanka. He continued to score ODI hundreds. On the 2018 tour to England, he rectified his poor run from the last England tour with a series of good scores, leading India to one win, but the team was defeated in close matches and lost the series 4–1. The same year Kohli became the 13th batsman to score 10,000 runs in ODIs, becoming the fastest to do so, in a full 54 innings fewer than Sachin Tendulkar had, previously the fastest.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">2018 - </span>On August 2 2018, Kohli registered his first Test century on English soil. Three days later, he became the No. 1 ranked Test batter of the world in the ICC Rankings. During an ODI series against West Indies in the same year, Kohli achieved the feat of becoming just the 12th batter to amass 10,000 ODI runs in the 50-over format.Kohli also won the 2018-19 Border Gavaskar Trophy later, becoming the first Asian and Indian skipper to win a Test series in Australia.
    </li>
    <li><span class="bold">2019 - </span>Kohli was named captain of the Indian team for the ODI World Cup in 2019. He scored five fifties in the tournament, which many considered below expectations for a player of his caliber. India lost to New Zealand in the semifinals, but Kohli became the fastest to 20,000 international runs across formats during the tournament. In a Test series against South Africa later that year, he scored his highest Test score of 254 not out. He was an all-format captain by now.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">2020–21 - </span> tour but returned home for the birth of his daughter after India’s defeat in the first Test. He was unable to return to Australia because of COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions and watched from India as Ajinkya Rahane rallied an injury-hit Indian side to a 2–1 series victory.
        Kohli’s performance subsequently dipped across formats, and he was not to hit another century for a few years, though he continued to score several fifties. During this period, India lost to New Zealand in the final of the inaugural World Test Championship in 2021 and failed to qualify for the knockout round in the 2021 T20I World Cup. Kohli subsequently resigned from T20I and ODI captaincy, both positions being taken over by Rohit Sharma.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">2022 - </span> Kohli stepped down from Test captaincy, and Sharma took over. Kohli had captained India in a record 68 Tests, winning 40 of them. He has been the most successful Indian captain by some distance with series wins both home and away, and his record compares favorably with great captains across eras.
        After poor performances for a few years, Kohli finally returned to form in spectacular fashion, scoring his first T20I hundred against Afghanistan in the 2022 Asia Cup, but India failed to qualify for the final. He was the top scorer in the 2022 T20I World Cup, in which India lost in the semifinals to eventual winner England. In that tournament he won high praise for his back-to-the-wall 82 not out in a successful chase against Pakistan.
    </span></li>
    <li><span class="bold">2023 - </span> In early 2023 Kohli got back to hitting ODI hundreds, beginning with a century against Sri Lanka. Against Australia, he scored his first Test century in three years in the fourth Test in Ahmedabad. He hit another ODI century against Pakistan in the 2023 Asia Cup.

        Kohli broke several records at the 2023 ODI World Cup. He surpassed 1,000 runs in the calendar year in a match against Sri Lanka, marking the eighth time he had done so and breaking Tendulkar’s record of seven such instances. In the match against South Africa, incidentally on his birthday, Kohli equaled Tendulkar’s record, which many cricket analysts believed would never be broken, of 49 ODI hundreds. In the semifinal against New Zealand in Mumbai, with Tendulkar in the audience, Kohli scored his record 50th ODI hundred. Kohli registered a half-century in the final, which India lost to Australia. He was adjudged Player of the Tournament for his 765 runs, a record for most runs in a single World Cup edition, breaking Tendulkar’s record (673) set in 2003.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">2024 - </span> Kohli wasn’t in good form in the 2024 T20I World Cup but he ended the series on a high, striking his first half-century of the tournament in the final match against South Africa, a match India won by 7 runs. Kohli declared his retirement from T20I cricket after he was declared Player of the Match.</li>
    <li><span class="bold">2025 - </span>  It was a vintage Virat Kohli who Pakistan had to deal with in Dubai during their Champions Trophy match against India, and the 36-year-old batted them out of the game with his 51st ODI century. Kohli paced his innings perfectly and helped India chase down a target of 242 with six wickets and 45 balls to spare. Kohli did both, hitting the winning runs with a four and finishing unbeaten on 100 off 111 balls. The star Indian batter Virat Kohli's remarkable 84-run knock against Australia in the first semi-final clash of the Champions Trophy 2025 proved why he is called the 'Chase Master'. The right-handed batter led the Men in Blue's batting lineup while chasing the target of 265 runs in Dubai on March 4. He smashed 84 runs from 98 balls at a strike rate of 85.71 against the Aussies.
